> **"This project was built with Vibe Coding — ideas first, perfection later."**

Thank you for your interest in contributing! We believe everyone with an idea can make this project better. No gatekeeping. No elitism. Just vibes.

## 🌟 Philosophy

MyStats was born from [Vibe Coding](https://x.com/karpathy/status/1886192184808149383) — a development approach where:
- **Speed > Perfection**: Ship fast, iterate faster
- **AI-Assisted**: We embrace AI tools (Gemini, Cursor, etc.)
- **Ideas Welcome**: You don't need to be a 10x dev to contribute
