**Title:** Show HN: MyStats – AI-powered self-discovery with Gemini/OpenAI/Claude/Grok

```
I built MyStats, an AI-powered self-discovery engine that analyzes journal entries to extract hidden psychological patterns.

Demo: https://mystats-eta.vercel.app
GitHub: https://github.com/kks0488/mystats

Key features:
- Journal freely → AI extracts skills, traits, archetypes
- Deep psychological profiling (inspired by Jungian psychology)
- Personalized strategy generation based on your profile
- 100% local storage (IndexedDB) - no backend, no tracking
- Korean/English bilingual output

Tech: React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind, multi-AI APIs (Gemini/OpenAI/Claude/Grok)

The interesting part is the "archetype detection" - the AI identifies patterns like "The Architect of Systems" or "The Reflective Grower" based on how you describe yourself.
